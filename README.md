## My process
This one really made me think a lot! especially withe  time off i took to focus on my academics. It was a good refreshing project to work on. I leaarnt new ways to style with material Ui and i get better with each project.

### Built with
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Material Ui

### What I learned
I learnt how to style more Material UI components and do it better. I learnt how to do more inline iternary operations too!

### Continued development
I will build more and more projects with React and material Ui till i fully get used to them both and the go forward and learn react native
